[[{"l":"README","p":["In the fall 2019, I was encouraged by Drew Devault to make my own blog. He wanted to see more people writing about their passions and thoughts, in a permanent way and through a public medium.","I was one of the 50-or-so people who jumped onboard and gave it a try. However, after one blog post, I realized it was going to be a lot more difficult than I had anticipated. What should I write about? How often? What if no one reads it? What if someone does? What if they aren't interested? But most of all, why would I write a blog?","It also turns out overthinking is the best way of not getting anything done.","So there it is! This blog will be dedicated to writing about tech stuff, things I'm interested in, personal reflections, side projects, personal references, and other subjects I may be interested about.","If it's your first time browsing my blog, you can find more about it here, as it describes this wiki's structure and philosophy.","Thoughts written here are my own and don't reflect any of my past, present or future employer's position.

This can make them confusing and hard to read.","With this in mind, I decided that I'd much rather organize my blog like a manual page or a book - with \"chapters\" and \"subchapters\". Hence, this blog is organized by topics I am interested in.","Each folder in the left panel refers to a topic. Each subpage is related to the parent topic.","I try to structure things so everyone can find them and benefit from reading them easily and quickly.","If you find any mistake, especially if something is plain wrong, you can fork this repository and make a push request with the correct changes. Alternatively, you can open an issue specifying what you think is wrong."]},{"l":"Content and philosophy","p":["Each topic should have a title, and at least some minor description if it grows over a certain amount of posts.","This blog contains thoughts on topics that I find interesting or that I am curious about, as well as knowledge and references to resources or links I have liked or used that helped me understand the topic or gain appreciation of it."]}]]
