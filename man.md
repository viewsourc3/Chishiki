Below you will find a few notes on the structure of this blog and the philosophy behind it.&#x20;

If this is the first time visiting this blog, you can start by reading from the top entry down and see what sparks your interest.&#x20;

### Blog Structure

Most blogs I see are organized chronologically. This can make them confusing and hard to read.

With this in mind, I decided that I'd much rather organize my blog like a manual page or a book - with "chapters" and "subchapters". Hence, this blog is organized by topics I am interested in.

Each folder in the left panel refers to a topic. Each subpage is related to the parent topic. A summary of all the pages can be found [here](SUMMARY.md).

I try to structure things so everyone can find them and benefit from reading them easily and quickly.

If you find any mistake, especially if something is plain wrong, you can fork this repository and make a push request with the correct changes. Alternatively, you can open an issue specifying what you think is wrong.



### Content and philosophy

Each topic should have a title, and at least some minor description if it grows over a certain amount of posts.

This blog contains thoughts on topics that I find interesting or that I am curious about, as well as knowledge and references to resources or links I have liked or used that helped me understand the topic or gain appreciation of it.
