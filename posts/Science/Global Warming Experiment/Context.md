In 2022, the [French National Centre for Scientific Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_National_Centre_for_Scientific_Research) launched a national-scale science project, named "Behind the blob, the research". Open to the general public throughout France, this experiment of unprecedented scope aims to study the effects of climate change on the blob.

I have been lucky enough to be one of the 15'000 selected volunteers to partake in this experiment. In this section, I will attempt to write a bit about the fascinating "thing" that is the Blob, record a few usefull information about the course of the experiment as well as some updates.
