In 2022, the [French National Centre for Scientific Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_National_Centre_for_Scientific_Research) launched a large-scale science project, named "Derri√®re le Blob, la recherche" (litt."Behind the blob, the research"). Open to the general public throughout the world, this experiment of unprecedented scope aims to study the effects of climate change on the blob.

I have been lucky enough to be one of the 15'000 selected volunteers to partake in this experiment. In this section, I will attempt to write about the fascinating "thing" that is the Blob, record a few usefull information on the course of the experiment as well as some updates.
