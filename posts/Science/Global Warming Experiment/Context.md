## Chosen by the blob.

In 2022, the [French National Centre for Scientific Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_National_Centre_for_Scientific_Research) launched a large-scale science project, named "Derrière le Blob, la recherche" (litt."Behind the blob, the research"). Open to the general public throughout the world, this experiment of unprecedented scope aims to study the effects of climate change on the blob.

46'000 people registered to be part of the experiment, for 15'000 blobs. The selection process was rather [unique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej3V6KuZcmU). All the volunteers were divided into 3 groups of equal sizes, labeled Group 1, Group 2 and Groupe 3. Each group was placed at an equal distance on the side of a Petri dish and identified by a drop of water filled with identical concentrations of sugar. A blob was placed in the center equidistant from the three drops of sugar water. After a few hours, it started to explore and detected the sugar molecules from groups 2 and 3 before that of group 1, hence selecting the volunteers in groups 2 and 3. (I was group 3 :-) ).

In this section, I will attempt to write about the fascinating "thing" that is the Blob, record a few usefull information on the course of the experiment as well as some updates.


## What is the Blob?

Its scientific, "real" name is: Physarum polycephalum. Mostly know as the Blob, as a tribute to a [movie of the same name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdUsyXQ8Wrs) from 1958, it is a rather unique single-cell organism. 

It's not an animal, nor a vegetable, nor a mushroom. It doesn't have a brain, but has learning capabilities. It can move, but has no legs. It has 720 different sexes. It can transmit information as it merges with other blobs. It can double in size daily and can reach several square meters. It's able to regenerate itself over the course of a few minutes, and its life span can easily reach several decades.

Although the story goes that the blob was discovered in [1973](https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/30/archives/blob-grows-in-dallas-housewife-is-puzzled.html), the first blobs appeared a billion years ago. The blob is composed of a cell but this can reach several meters in diameter (in comparison, a human cell measures on average ten micrometers in diameter, or ten million times less!)

Just like humans, the blob, is the result of the fusion of two sex cells. In a proper environment, their spores are released into the air. When two cells of opposite sex meet (which isn't too complicated, since there are 720 sexes out there...), they fuse to become a single cell. But, unlike us, the cell will not divide. Its nucleus will. Therefore, the cell grows according to the divisions of its nuclei, until it reaches record sizes.

Blobs are mostly found in humid and shady areas of forests. When environmental conditions are bad (drought or lack of food) the blob turns into a [sclerotium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerotium), which is a dormant state, until the situation improves. It can stay that way for years.

There are hundreds, if not thousands of different kind of blobs. The most common, being the Physarum polycephalum. It is bright yellow and formless. It is notably made up of a network of 'veins', which makes it move and allows the redistribute of all the nutrients and other essential proteins in the most efficient way possible.


## Objective of the experiment

Human beings can acclimatise themselves to a wide range of temperature and humidity. When traveling to high altitudes, our bodies adjust so that our cells still receive sufficient oxygen. When traveling in a very warm country, our body rids itself of excess heat by sweating. This ability, which is likely the results of thousands of years of acclimatisation, has made it possible for us to survive in most regions of Earth, from tropical countries, to harsh deserts, and arctic countries -- while most animals, and especially mammals, are restricted to a few environments. 

While we often imagine global warming as a steady and regular increase of global temperature, it, in fact, manifests itself in a few different ways. One of the most impactful ones is through abrupt changes of temperature and environment. Essentially, these abrupt climate change are surprising (non-linear) changes in the climate system which results in a new climate state, much more suddenly than what is expected. And the more abrupt, the less efficient a population is in adaptation, and can, eventually, dwindle and become extinct.

The aim of the experiment is to study whether the growth of the blob and its behavior will be affected by regular and/or sudden changes in temperature. The blobs will be subjected to different temperature profiles. 


## The protocol

The protocol is public and freely accessible [here (in french)](https://www.cnrs.fr/en/node/6451). Anyone with a blob may follow or recreate the experiment.

I have been attributed one strain of blob called Badhamia Utricularis, which are mostly slow compared to Physarum Polycephalum, especially in the wake up phase (I like him already).

I am asked to follow 4 protocols (2, 3, 10 and 15), which will be detailed in the upcoming sections, but are summarised as followed : 
 - Gradual drop in temperature (5 days)
 - Increase in temperature over 1 day (5 days)
 - Low intensity increase over 2 days (5 days)
 - Five successive increases in temperature (10 days)
