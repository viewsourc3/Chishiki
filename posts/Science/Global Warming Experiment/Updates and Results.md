+++ Waking up the Blob

This section details the awakening stage and early development of the blob. The purpose of this stage is to "wake up" the blob, which was sent in the form of a sclerotium, make it reach a significant size, while multiplying it over 8 petri dishes (4 ctrl and 4 exp dishes). 

Instructions for this stage can be found [here](https://www.cnrs.fr/sites/default/files/download-file/Re%CC%81veil_et_croissance.pdf) (CNRS, french).

Feel free to right click and open pictures in a new tab for full resolution.

The above tabs will allow to follow the progress of the different experimental protocols I'll be following.



### Day 1.  2022.04.23, saturday. 3:30pm.

##### Steps. 
1. Take out two boxes from the Petri refrigerator: control box no. 1 and experimental box no. 1.
2. Cut each sclerotium (4) in half.
3. Briefly dip each sclerotium (8) in a glass of water.
4. Drain.
5. Place each half of the sclerotium on the left half of the petri dish with agar base (one half in the petri dish Ctrl #1, the other half in the petri dish Exp #1).
6. Fill the right side of each petri dish with the equivalent of one soda bottle cap of oatmeal (the cap should be full but the flakes should not stick out).
7. Take a photo so that you can later measure the size of the sclerotia (not all volunteers will have sclerotia of exactly the same size).
8. Place the two petri dishes in the blob-house.
9. Read the temperature in both blob-houses (the values should be identical). 

##### Notes.
  - Temperature in the Ctrl #1 is : 20.1ºC
  - Temperature in the Exp #1 is : 19.7ºC

##### Pictures.

### Day 2. 2022.04.24, sunday. 3:45pm

##### Notes. 
  - The first few pieces of oatmeal are covered. 
  - The colour is quite more vibrant. Connections has been made between the pieces of blob. It's alive :) 
  - Temperature in the Ctrl #2 is : 21.0ºC
  - Temperature in the Exp #2 is : 20.9ºC

##### Steps. 
Considering the oatmeal isn't covered by the blob, and as per instructions, I'll give it more time before transfering it to a new petri dish. 



### Day 3. 2022.04.25, monday. 6:30am

<figcaption><center><small><i>Day 3, Ctrl and Exp dish before steps.</I></small></center></figcaption>

##### Notes. 
  - Little change in development. 
  - Temperature in the Ctrl #3 is : 19.7ºC
  - Temperature in the Exp #3 is : 19.9ºC

##### Steps. 
1. For both petri dish, separate the blob in two along the H-B axis.
2. Disregard the oldest part (on the left), including the paper as well as the oatmeal. 
3. Transfer the new/awaken part (on the right) to the left side of a new petri dish (#3).

   <figcaption><center><small><i>Step 2 and 3.</i></small></center></figcaption>
4. Add oatmeal on the right side of petri dish #3. 
5. I have raised the temperature inside the box to roughly 22ºC to encourage growth.

### Day 4. 2022.04.26, Tuesday. 8:00pm.

<figcaption><center><small><i>Day 4, Ctrl and Exp dish before steps.</I></small></center></figcaption>

##### Notes. 

  - I can notice some form of mold on the old agar base (left side of picture). I don't suppose this is an issue since the left part (the oldest part) of the petri dish must be thrown away during this stage.
  - Good progress overall! Even if the blob in the Exp box is still somewhat lazy... Perhaps I should spread the oatmeal over a larger area to promote growth. 
  - Temperature in the Ctrl #4 is : 19.4ºC
  - Temperature in the Exp #4 is : 19.5ºC

##### Steps. 

Identical to yesterday.

1. For both petri dish, separate the blob in two along the H-B axis.
2. Disregard the oldest part (on the left), including the paper as well as the oatmeal. 
3. Transfer the new/awaken part (on the right) to the left side of a new petri dish (#3).

4. Add oatmeal on the right side of petri dish #4. I've tried to spread them more evenly.
5. I have raised the temperature inside the box to roughly 22ºC to encourage growth.
