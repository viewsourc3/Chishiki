## Waking up the Blob

#### Day 1.  2022.04.23, saturday.

- Steps. 
1. Take out two boxes from the Petri refrigerator: control box no. 1 and experimental box no. 1.
2. Cut each sclerotium (4) is half.
3. Briefly dip each sclerotium (8) in a glass of water.
4. Drain.
5. Place each half of the sclerotium on the left half of the petri dish (one half in the control petri dish, the other half in the experiment petri dish).
6. Fill the right side of each petri dish with the equivalent of one soda bottle cap of oatmeal (the cap should be full but the flakes should not stick out).
7. Take a photo so that you can later measure the size of the sclerotia (not all volunteers will have sclerotia of exactly the same size).
8. Place the two petri dishes in the blob-house.
9. Read the temperature in both blob-houses (the values should be identical). 

- Notes.

  

  Temperature in the Ctrl_box is : 20.1ºC
  Temperature in the Exp_box is : 19.7ºC
  Time : 15:33

#### Day 2. 2022.04.24, sunday.

- Notes. 

  

  The colour is quite more vibrant! It's alive :) 
  The first few pieces of oatmeal are covered. 

  Temperature in the Ctrl_box is : 21.0ºC
  Temperature in the Exp_box is : 20.9ºC
  Time : 15:45

  

- Steps. 

  

  Considering the oatmeal isn't covered by the blob, and as per instructions, I'll wait until tomorrow to transfert the blobs in the second Petri dish.
