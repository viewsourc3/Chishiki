+++ Waking up the Blob

This section details the awakening stage and early development of the blob. The purpose of this stage is to "wake up" the blob, which was sent in the form of a sclerotium, and make it reach a significant size in order to duplicate it over 8 petri dishes. This, because the protocol requires the volunteers to run the experiments over 4 control blobs and compare the results to 4 experimental blobs.

The above tabs will allow to follow the progress of the different experimental protocols I'll be following, in due time.

I have been attributed a strain of blob called Badhamia Utricularis, which are mostly slow compared to Physarum Polycephalum, especially in the wake up phase. This stage should typically be done over the course of a week, but I expect it to last around 10 days. It should not be tedious, as it mainly consists playing the waiting game while ensuring the blob doesn't show any sign of mold.

Instructions for this stage can be found [here](https://www.cnrs.fr/sites/default/files/download-file/Re%CC%81veil_et_croissance.pdf) (CNRS, french).

Feel free to right click and open pictures in a new tab for full resolution.

## preliminary steps. 
To ensure the highest reliability and reproducibility of results, all volunteers must follow identical waking and rearing conditions. 

This implies making sure we all have an identical experimental space and use the same equipment. I will not detail these prerequisites. They can be found [here](https://www.cnrs.fr/sites/default/files/download-file/Preparatifs.pdf) (environment, CNRS, French) and [here](https://www.cnrs.fr/sites/default/files/download-file/BlobCNRS_ListeDuMateriel_7.pdf) (equipment, CNRS, French).

## Day 1.  2022.04.23, saturday. 3:30pm.

#### Steps. 
1. Take out two petri boxes from the refrigerator: control box no. 1 and experimental box no. 1.
2. Cut each sclerotium (4) in half.
3. Briefly dip each sclerotium (8) in a glass of water.
4. Drain.
5. Place each half of the sclerotium on the left half of the petri dish with agar base (one half in the petri dish Ctrl #1, the other half in the petri dish Exp #1).
6. Fill the right side of each petri dish with the equivalent of one soda bottle cap of oatmeal (the cap should be full but the flakes should not stick out).
7. Take a photo so that you can later measure the size of the sclerotia (not all volunteers will have sclerotia of exactly the same size).
8. Place the two petri dishes in the blob-house.
9. Read the temperature in both blob-houses (the values should be identical). 

#### Notes.
  - Temperature in the Ctrl #1 is : 20.1ºC
  - Temperature in the Exp #1 is : 19.7ºC

#### Pictures.

<br/>

#### Notes. 
  - The first few pieces of oatmeal are covered. 
  - The colour is quite more vibrant. Connections has been made between the pieces of blob. It's alive :) 
  - Temperature in the Ctrl #2 is : 21.0ºC
  - Temperature in the Exp #2 is : 20.9ºC

#### Steps. 
Considering the oatmeal isn't covered by the blob, and as per instructions, I'll give it more time before transfering it to a new petri dish.

## Day 3. 2022.04.25, monday. 6:30am

<figcaption><small><i>Day 3, Ctrl and Exp dish before steps.</I></small></figcaption>
<br/>

#### Notes. 
  - Little change in development. 
  - Temperature in the Ctrl #3 is : 19.7ºC
  - Temperature in the Exp #3 is : 19.9ºC

#### Steps. 
1. For both petri dish, separate the blob in two along the H-B axis.
2. Disregard the oldest part (on the left), as well as the oatmeal.
3. Transfer the newest/awaken part (on the right) to the left side of a new petri dish (#3).
4. Add oatmeal on the right side of petri dish #3. 
5. I have raised the temperature inside the box to roughly 22ºC to encourage growth.

## Day 4. 2022.04.26, Tuesday. 8:00pm.

<figcaption><small><i>Day 4, Ctrl and Exp dish before steps.</I></small></figcaption>
<br/>

#### Notes. 

  - I can notice some form of mold on the old agar base (left side of picture). I don't suppose this is an issue since the left part (the oldest part) of the petri dish must be thrown away during this stage.
  - Good progress overall! Even if the blob in the Exp box is still somewhat lazy... Perhaps I should spread the oatmeal over a larger area to promote growth. 
  - Temperature in the Ctrl #4 is : 19.4ºC
  - Temperature in the Exp #4 is : 19.5ºC

#### Steps. 

Identical to yesterday.

1. For both petri dish, separate the blob in two along the H-B axis.
2. Disregard the oldest part (on the left), as well as the oatmeal. 
3. Transfer the newest part (on the right) to the left side of a new petri dish (#4). 
4. Add oatmeal on the right side of petri dish #4. I've tried to spread them more evenly.
5. I have raised the temperature inside the box to roughly 22ºC to encourage growth.

<br/>

#### Notes. 

  - Exp box is catching up. 
  - Temperature in the Ctrl #4 is : 19.3ºC
  - Temperature in the Exp #4 is : 19.4ºC

#### Steps. 

Identical to yesterday.

1. For both petri dish, separate the blob in two along the H-B axis.
2. Disregard the oldest part (on the left), as well as the oatmeal. 
3. Transfer the newest part (on the right) to the left side of a new petri dish (#5). 
4. Add oatmeal on the right side of petri dish #5. I've added less oatmeal this time, but more evenly spread to encourage expansion.
5. I have raised the temperature inside the box to roughly 22ºC to encourage growth.

## Day 6. 2022.04.28, Thursday. 8:30pm.

<figcaption><small><i>Day 6, Ctrl and Exp dish before steps.</i></small></figcaption>
<br/>

#### Notes. 

  - The blob has fully covered the right half of both petri dish. 
  - It seems like less and more evenly spread oatmeal do encourage growth (which makes sense since the blob need to search for food by moving further) 
  - Temperature in the Ctrl #4 is : 19.7ºC
  - Temperature in the Exp #4 is : 19.6ºC

#### Steps. 
It is now time to duplicate the blob! 

1. For both petri dish, separate the blob in two along the H-B axis.
2. Place the oldest part (on the left), in a new petri dish (#7). 
3. Transfer the newest part (on the right) to the left side of a new petri dish (#8). 
4. Add oatmeal on the right side of petri dish #7 & 8.
