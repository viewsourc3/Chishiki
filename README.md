# README

In the fall 2019, I was encouraged by [Drew Devault](https://github.com/ddevault) to make my own blog. He wanted to see more people writing about their passions and thoughts, in a permanent way and through a public medium.

I was one of the 50-or-so people who jumped onboard and gave it a try. However, after one blog post, I realized it was going to be a lot more difficult than I had anticipated. What should I write about? How often? What if no one reads it? What if someone does? What if they aren't interested? But most of all, why would I write a blog?

It also turns out overthinking is the best way of not getting anything done.

So there it is! This blog will be dedicated to writing about tech stuff, things I'm interested in, personal reflections, side projects, personal references, and other subjects I may be interested about.

If it's your first time browsing my blog, you can find more about it [here](man.md), as it describes this wiki's structure and philosophy.
